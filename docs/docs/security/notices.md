# Security notices

This page is the running record of security-relevant changes in NSClient++ —
both published advisories (with their CVE / GHSA identifiers) and security
**hardening** that changed behaviour but was not assigned a CVE. It complements
the GitHub [Security Advisories](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/security/advisories)
tab, which lists only *published* advisories and so does not capture hardening
changes.

- To **report** a vulnerability, follow the
  [security policy](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- For the concrete operator actions a given release requires, see
  [Upgrading](../setup/upgrading.md).

## Published advisories

| Advisory | CVE | Severity | Affected | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [GHSA-rhrw-79v5-jc5x](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/security/advisories/GHSA-rhrw-79v5-jc5x) | CVE-2025-34079 | High (7.8) | 0.5.2.35 and earlier | Authenticated remote code execution via `ExternalScripts`. |
| [GHSA-jr25-22p3-gm6r](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/security/advisories/GHSA-jr25-22p3-gm6r) | CVE-2025-34078 | High (7.8) | 0.5.2.35 and earlier | Local privilege escalation from plaintext credentials in the configuration file. |

### CVE-2025-34079 — Authenticated RCE via ExternalScripts

An attacker who already holds valid administrator credentials can register and
run an external script, achieving remote code execution. It affects the legacy
`0.5.2.35` architecture that predates the current REST v2 API.

**What to do:** upgrade to a current supported release, and restrict who can
configure `ExternalScripts` / hold an administrator role. See the
[external scripts](../scenarios/external-scripts.md) and
[permissions](../concepts/permissions.md) guidance. Full detail:
[GHSA-rhrw-79v5-jc5x](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/security/advisories/GHSA-rhrw-79v5-jc5x).

### CVE-2025-34078 — Local privilege escalation via plaintext credentials

A principal with local filesystem access can read plaintext credentials stored
in `nsclient.ini` and reuse them. It affects the legacy `0.5.2.35` architecture.

**What to do:** upgrade to a current supported release; lock down the
configuration file with filesystem ACLs and, where possible, move sensitive
values into the credential manager (see
[Securing NSClient++](../setup/securing.md)). Full detail:
[GHSA-jr25-22p3-gm6r](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/security/advisories/GHSA-jr25-22p3-gm6r).

## Hardening changes (no CVE)

Security-relevant changes that are handled as defense-in-depth / consistency
hardening rather than assigned a CVE are listed here as they ship, newest
first, alongside the release that contains them.

_No hardening notices recorded yet._
