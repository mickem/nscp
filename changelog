2012-12-25 MickeM
 * Added option scan-range to CheckEventLog.
   This new option reduces the entries scanned a *lot* and can help solve memory, time and CPU issues.
   The idea is that is negative we start scanning from the end and once we hit something outsiden the range we stop scanning.
   There is a chanse that entries reported are "outside" the range so set range bigger then generate/written date/times (to reduce this risk).
     CheckEventLog file=application file=system MaxWarn=1 MaxCrit=1 "filter=generated gt -1h AND level eq 'info'" truncate=800 unique descriptions "syntax=%severity%: %source%: %message% (%count%)"
   Executes in 7 seconds adding scan-range=-5h executes in 0 seconds (yields the same result).

      nscp lua --log debug .. --script foo.lua --log this-is-a-lua-argument
    But perhaps more importantly you can do:

 * Fixed issue with parsing "invalid external commands".
   If parsing falies it will notify you but use the legacy split string method instead.
 * LuaScript module is now modern (ie. works with 0.4.0)
   Should be 99% compatbile (function needs to be defined before registration) but all old scripts should work now (I think)
 * LuaScript module has been modernized
   The new API is very similar to Python
   Concepts are working but not all commands have beenh implementes (and no testcases either)
   The old API will still work
 * Fixed issue with 

2012-01-27 MickeM
 * Changed CheckCounter format option to take a coma separated list of keyword from the below list:
	 nocap100: Counter values above 100 (for example, counter values measuring the processor load on multiprocessor computers) will not be reset to 100. The default behavior is that counter values are capped at a value of 100.
	 1000: Multiply the actual value by 1000.
	 noscale: Do not apply the default scaling factor.
	 So format=nocap100,noscale would combine the two aspects above.

 * Added WarnHungCount/CritHungCount exact bounds to CheckProcState so:
   CheckProcState CritHungCount=gt:50 WarnHungCount=ne:45 svchost.exe
 * Changed so Count takes presedence meaning if you specify: CheckProcState CritCount=gt:50 svchost.exe=stopped it will be treated 
   as (CheckProcState CritCount=gt:50 svchost.exe) hence the stopped/started is meaningless if you specify a count.
 * Fixed so perfoamnce data parsin handled non escaped \:es (ie. using stupiud parsing)
 * Added a lot of unittests to CheckProcState to verify that many features work properly.
    nscp python --script test_w32_system.py --install

 + Added shared session so system tray can communicate with master
 + Added new system tray handlig (via TS so FUS should work with it)
 + Added new option [System] / shared_session=0 (or 1) to enable / disable the new shared memory framework (it is for now disabled by default)

 * Fixed issue with CheckFile and performance data ( #156 )
 + Added option (InvalidStatus) to CheckCounter to allow other then UNKNOWN return state when counters are missing ( #167 ).
   *NOTICE* this is all reasons (so if the counter is missing or some such the same will happen not just when the instance is missing)
   Message will reflect reason.
 * Fixed issue in the arraybuffer (one of the plit functions had a problem with multiple chars of the same) ( #190 )

 * Moved COM init to "core" (from WMI module)
 + Added new Check command: CheckTaskSched Use like so:
     CheckTaskSched +filter-exit-code==1 ShowAll MaxWarn=1 MaxCrit=1

2008-03-21 MickeM
 + Added command line support for process checks
   New option: cmdLine will toggle so full command lines are used instead of just process names.
 + Added regular expression matching to process checks
   New option: match=regexp (match=strings is the default and "old" way)
 + Added substring matching to process checks
   New option: match=substr (match=strings is the default and "old" way)
   This is *NOT* case blind so might be hard to use, plan to add case blindness to it in the future.
 : Sample command: check_nt ... -v PROCSTATE -l cmdLine,match=regexp,.*exp.* -d SHOWALL
 * Ohh yeah... it is 2008 this year... not 2007, fixed a few entries in the change log :)

   syntax: function debug (command, args) -- args is a table with all arguments

2008-03-11 MickeM
 ! 0.3.1 Released

2008-03-08 MickeM
 * Changed so log is now in Unicode format
   Hopefully this will make it simpler to diagnose PDH issues in "strange locales".
   If anyone hates this let me know and I will add an option to use "old ansi log".
 * Fixed so the console is logged as ANSI (properly) and all Unicode's are discarded.
   This means "strangeness" in Unicode and non-us-ascii chars on the console,
    so for details refer to the log-file which is proper Unicode.
 + Since log module is loaded "after" the client has booted I added a "hello" message that prints the current version
    (if you find this annoying let me know, I will make it optional :)
 * Fixed some issues in the registry handling

2008-03-06 MickeM
 * Fixed silly ordering bug with the <> syntax.

2008-03-05 MickeM
 + Added debug to new section [Eventlog], when enabled it will (log) what lines matched what, this is a pretty big performance overhead so don't run with this one.
 + Added syntax to new section [Eventlog] used as a shorthand for the syntax to use as "default" (when no syntax=... option is given)
 * Fixed an issue with eventlog and . matching.
 + Added shorthand ! for != in "all" numeric filters (eventlog)
 + Added <> (same as ! and !=) as NRPE breaks the use of ! (in "all" numeric filters (eventlog))
   Try using: filter-eventType=<>warning to remove everything that is not a warning
 * Fixed two spelling mistakes in the SysTray module.
 * Fixed 64-bit issues with installer
 * Fixed so installer uninstalls/installs the service
 
2008-02-26 MickeM
 + Added installer
 
2008-02-22 MickeM
 * Fixed issues in the NRPE module (now returns the correct status)
 + Added a lot of "error log" for when the packet size in NRPEListener is not correct 
    (might make it simpler to diagnose problems)

2008-02-20 MickeM
 + Added new module NRPEClient that can act as a NRPE client, might be useful for testing things and 
   eventually for relaying events.
   Usage: nsclient++ -noboot NRPEClient -H 192.168.0.1 -p 5666 -c check_something -a foo bar
   This is an early concept so don't expect much...
 * Fixed a bug in NSCA module (now it works again :)
 + Added a command wrapper for the NRPECLient module so now it can act as a check command.
   (No argument handling yet though), For a sample check out the [NRPE Client Handlers] section in NSC.ini

2008-02-19 MickeM
 + Fixed a buffer overflow in the NRPE socket handling.
 
2008-02-18 MickeM
 + Added proper output handling to process subsystem (now you can execute programs that return "much" data.
 + Added select support for SSL_write (now you can send "any amount of data" to the (SSL) socket.
   Since check_nrpe doesn't do this it wont work in that end, but still...

2008-02-16 MickeM
 + Re factored ExternalCommand handling so NRPE and new module does the same thing.

2008-02-14 MickeM
 + Added so commands starting in host_ (NSCA Handlers) are sent as host-commands
 * Fixed a copy constructor in NSCA Commands (now service checks are sent as service checks)

2008-02-13 MickeM
 + Added string_length to [Settings] as well (used internally) for all "injected" buffers.
 * Fixed issue with scripts result truncated after 1024 chars 
    (now they return "all" output and thus you can use the NRPE settings I added yesterday :)
 + Added hostname setting to [NSCA] section (must have been  when I did not add it before)
 + Added to NSCA truncates output when to long.

2008-02-12 MickeM
 + Added new option for the [NRPE] section string_length which is the length of the NRPE strings 
   (notice you need to recompile the check_nrpe to match this value)
 * Improved exception handling in the PDH collector (hopefully less deadlocks)

2008-02-11 MickeM
 + Added encryption support for NSCA module (about half of the algorithms are available, 
     if someone wants to use one not available let me know, and I will try to add it)

2008-02-09 MickeM
 + New module CheckExternalScripts to handle 1, external script (similar to the old NRPE but in its own module)
   - Can Check batch/vbs/programs/*
   - Works with NSCA module (if you don't want to have NRPE at the same time)
   - Simpler syntax (discarded old and added new section for alias)
   - Started to add "sample alias" to ease initial setup and give some nice ideas (please provide me with feedback on them)

2008-02-08 MickeM
 + Added some more default catch handlers (on the "core" side of plugin-calls).

2008-02-07 MickeM

 + Added API for scripts to register commands
 + Added command descriptions (for some modules)
 * Fixed issue in NRPE that displayed a console window when running commands
 * New improved "inject" dialog from the system tray
   Lists available commands, and shows command descriptions and a lot of other improvements.
 + Added an internal log windows that displays log in real-time.
 + Fixed some issues with the dialog procs (should work smoother now, especially Termination)

2008-02-02 MickeM
 * Might have fixed the "missing eventlog messages" problem.
 + Added %count% parameter to syntax which (when used with unique) will display the number of hits for each message displayed.

2008-01-27 MickeM
 * Fixed a memory-leak in format_time
 * Fixed so time/date is displayed in "local time" (not UTC) for the eventlog check
 + Added %message% to eventlog check. Will display the "proper formated eventlog message" as in the eventlog viewer.
   For this to work you need to have the descriptions flag set
   In short: /nrpe -H 192.168.0.147 -c checkEventLog -a truncate=1024 "syntax=%generated%: %message%" descriptions=true file=System MaxWarn=1 MaxCrit=1 filter+eventType==error filter+generated=\<12h filter=new filter=all filter=in
 + Added option "unique" to CheckEventLog If this is present only unique errors will be returned.
   The uniqueness is defined by event-log, event-source, event-id and event-category.

2007-12-16 MickeM

2007-12-09 MickeM
 + Added a check if the service is started when running with /test so you get a warning
 + Improved the socket thread with:
    * a default-catch
    * If the socket fails to start we still wait for it to shut down (no error message)
 + Added first version of the NSCA agent (NSCAgent.dll)
   (no encryption support as of yet, but will come)

    append: .<date string> if you want to use a "custom date" like so: ... -v FILEAGE -l c:\\windows,Date: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" -w 5 -c 6 ...
    Only the above listed %<char> works, and default to 0 so might not be to pretty but works...

     CheckWMIValue -a "Query=select Caption, ThreadCount from Win32_Process" MaxWarn=50 MaxCrit=100 Check:threads=ThreadCount AliasCol=Caption
    will give you: "System threads: 98 > warning, svchost.exe threads: 87 > warning"

 * Fixed a display error in the various size functions (1000-1024 byte was displayed incorrectly)

2006-10-05 MickeM
 * Yayyy!!! (first fix in a looong while :)
 * Fixed a W2k3 "bug" (actually just an incorrect error) but the:
   "e .\PDHCollector.cpp(130) Failed to query performance counters..." is no more...
 + Added option to NRPE/NSClient section to not-cache host names (for dyndns etc.)
   NOTICE this is "not safe" really in so far as someone might hi-jack your DNS and quickly gain 
   access to your nagios box (probably only a theoretical problem but hey! :)
   NOTICE this is "slow" since all hosts in the list are "looked up" each time you get a NRPE/NSClient 
   request it will be "slow" but I think it is not that much of a problem really.
   NOTICE I don't have the possibility to test this so feel free to report if it works and if it doesn't.
   Set cache_allowed_hosts=0 to disable host cache

2006-04-04 MickeM
 * Fixed a few more bugs to the INI/REG readers

2006-04-02 MickeM
 * Could all magicians stop trying to kill me? 
   *Please* i don't like to die!

2006-03-31 MickeM
 * Damn necromancers! stop 0wning my ass all the time!
 
2006-03-29 MickeM
 + Added API for saving/reading settings
 
2006-03-28 MickeM
 + Added REG/INI parsers
 * *NOTICE* You need to add an option (use_file=1) to your nsc.ini file or new builds wont work.

2006-03-25 MickeM
 * Oblivion f*cking roxx!

2006-03-02 MickeM
 * Fixed bug in INI-file reader (memory leak)

2006-03-01 MickeM
 * Fixed bug in CheckFile (now dates work correctly)

2006-02-26 MickeM
 + Added syntax option to CheckFile (%filename%, %creation%, %access%, %write%, %size%).

2006-02-25 MickeM
 * Fixed Sections problem (now sections can be any size)
 + Added bind_to_address option to both NRPE and NSClient section in the INI file.
   Allows you to bind the listener to a specific IP address (only dotted number not host name).
   This might break things as I had to do some internal rewrite of the Socket classes so be careful :)
 * Disabled default-debug logging (as things are fairly stable, you can still enable it by using debug=1 in the NSC:ini file)
 * "Fixed" socket backlog to use "max responsible value" as opposed to "10" if no value is specified.
 + Added option socket_back_log to both NRPE and NSClient section that allows you to tweak the "back-log" of incoming connections to keep.
   This is an advanced setting and should not be used. If you get "connection refused" when running many client this might be something you want to tweak though.
   And if you then start getting "Socket timeout" you might wanna tweak the timeout value as well because larger value here means it takes "longer" to process a socket.
 - I have looked into the event log problem and dates seem to work here so if anyone still have problems (use the syntax option to debug) let me know.
 * Moved listpdh and debugpdh into the CheckSystem module
 * Removed PDH dependencies from "core exe" means you can run NSClient++ without PDH (though you cant use the CheckSystem module)
 
2006-02-2? MickeM
 + Added new Interface for Modules (NSCommandLineExec that allows modules to execute things give from command line.
   Syntax is NSClient++ <module name> <command> [arguments] and if a module doesn't support this it is simply ignored.
 + Added new install/uninstall command to SystemTray module:
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray install 
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray uninstall 
   That will install/uninstall the system tray module this sets the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag for the service.
 * Removed the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag from the /install option so that it no longer defaults to on (see commands to set this above).
 * Fixed so checkProcess isn't case sensitive.
 * Added (not finished) syntax option to event log checker to format the outputted data

2006-02-12 MickeM
 + Added support for host name resolve to allowed_hosts

2006-02-08 MickeM
 ! Fixed filter-eventID in EventLog module (now works for all IDs regardless of severity state)
 + Added new filters to EventLog (filter-severity that can filter based on event severity success, error, warning, informational)

2006-02-07 MickeM
 + Added new filter option to eventlog filter-eventID
 + Added new operator to all numeric filters in:number,number,... etc. (for instance filter-eventID=in:123,456,789 to check for lists.

2006-02-05 MickeM
 + Added CheckFile check command
   This new command (in development) will allow various file checks such as age, size, date, etc on single or multiple files.
 + Added FILEAGE support to NSClient
 + Started to convert the web page to WIKI
 
2006-01-21 MickeM
 + Added WMI Check module (early alpha)
   This is an extremely early alpha more to see if there is an interest and how to progress with it.
   To use the WMI module enable the WMICheck.dll (nsc.ini) and then run the following check:
   CheckWMI MaxWarn=10 MaxCrit=15 "Query:load=Select LoadPercentage from win32_Processor"
   The Max* are as every other check and sets limits. 
   The Query works similarly to other check commands i.e.. Query:<name>=<WMI query>
   So any other WMI query should work (notice this is experimental and not stable and has virtually 
   no error handling so it is likely to crash nsclient if you ask anything "non working".)
   I would *really* *really* like to get feedback on how to expand this concept to work better so feel free to come with feedback.
  * Fixed NT4 /install (should work now!)

2006-01-02 MickeM
