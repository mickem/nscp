2008-09-12 MickeM
 * Thanks to everyone who listened in on my session at NETWAYS Nagios Konferenz 2008!

2008-09-09 MickeM - 0.3.4 RC-3

 * Fixed performance data for "large float values" to be rendered without scientific notation. (#151)
 * Fixed issue with & and some commands via check_nt.
 * Fixed a crash on exit (which I added in Rc1).

 * Fixed an issue making powershell scripts (and possibly others) not timeout properly.
 + Added upgrade support to the installer (still need to add support for keeping .ini file so be ware)

2008-09-06 MickeM
 * Improved error reporting in the eventlogchecker

   I Recomend everyone to stop using the "old" filtering.

2008-09-04 MickeM
 * Fixed issues with new service stuff on NT4 and W2K (should work fine now)
 + Added some DebugOutput to service handling features so if you experience tropubel try using sysinternals DebugView too se logging before the agent startes.
 * Fixed a memory leak in the error formating code

2008-08-24 MickeM

 * *WARNING* A lot of new untested code here so dont run in production enviornments :)
 + Added shared session so system tray can communicate with master
 + Added new system tray handlig (via TS so FUS should work with it)
 + Added new option [System] / shared_session=0 (or 1) to enable / disable the new shared memory framework (it is for now disabled by default)
   If you want to try this remember to change that option but also beware! it is dagerous and not finnished and and also there is as of now no security at all.

2008-08-09 MickeM
 + Added ChangeWindowMessageFilter so systray should maybe work on vista and beyond!

2008-07-28 MickeM
 * Improved the error handling for the check proc state.
 * Removed all (I think) asserts replacing them with exceptions (should I hope reduce crashes and instead leave some form of errors)

   CheckWMI namespace=root\\cimv2 MaxCrit=3 MinWarn=1 "Query:load=Select * from win32_Processor"

2008-06-30 MickeM
 * Fixed issue with CheckFile and performance data ( #156 )
 + Added option (InvalidStatus) to CheckCounter to allow other then UNKNOWN return state when counters are missing ( #167 ).
   *NOTICE* this is all reasons (so if the counter is missing or some such the same will happen not just when the instance is missing)
   Message will reflect reason.
 * Fixed issue in the arraybuffer (one of the plit functions had a problem with multiple chars of the same) ( #190 )

2008-06-25 MickeM

   + CheckDriveSize now uses "all drives" when no drive is specified.
   * Fixed misspellt Container

2008-06-14 MickeM
 * Fixed error message from external commands (better reporting now)

2008-05-14 MickeM
 * Fixed memoryleak in the service checker.
     I am really sorry I usualy write better code then this.

 * BREAKING CHANGE! -- THe API function NSCLoadPlugin has been changed to take an integer to define the load-status

2008-06-?? MickeM
 * BREAKING CHANGE! -- New settings API as well as new WEBConfiguration UI (nothing is finnished yet but I wanted to check things into the SVN since it is a lot of changes now :)

2008-05-14 MickeM
 * Fixed memoryleak in the service checker.
     I am really sorry I usualy write better code then this.

2008-05-11 MickeM
 * BREAKING CHANGE! -- Changed PDH options to a more uniform design:
     auto_detect_pdh and dont_use_pdh_index has been removed and instead there is a new method option that takes various values.

2008-04-03 MickeM
 * Moved COM init to "core" (from WMI module)
 + Added new Check command: CheckTaskSched Use like so:
     CheckTaskSched +filter-exit-code==1 ShowAll MaxWarn=1 MaxCrit=1

2008-03-21 MickeM
 + Added command line support for process checks
   New option: cmdLine will toggle so full command lines are used instead of just process names.
 + Added regular expression matching to process checks
   New option: match=regexp (match=strings is the default and "old" way)
 + Added substring matching to process checks
   New option: match=substr (match=strings is the default and "old" way)
   This is *NOT* case blind so might be hard to use, plan to add case blindness to it in the future.
 : Sample command: check_nt ... -v PROCSTATE -l cmdLine,match=regexp,.*exp.* -d SHOWALL
 * Ohh yeah... it is 2008 this year... not 2007, fixed a few entries in the change log :)
 - BREAKING CHANGE! -- Removed TOOLHELPER API as PSAPI is simpler and toolhelp is really only useful on w9x (which I don't officially support)

 + Added host-lookupos for NSCA server (#149)
 + Added option (cache_hostname=1|0) to cache the NSCA host name (Ie. only lookup once)
 * Fixed service check: check_nt -v SERVICESTATE -l CheckAll so it works as advertised (#150)
 * Fixed issue with check_nt MEMUSE/CPULOAD/UPTIME if something is "broken" they will now return an error instead of "0". (#134)

2008-03-18 MickeM
 * Added some more error messages to the NSCA module
 * Added support for arguments to LUA module.
   syntax: function debug (command, args) -- args is a table with all arguments

2008-03-11 MickeM
 ! 0.3.1 Released

2008-03-08 MickeM
 * Changed so log is now in Unicode format
   Hopefully this will make it simpler to diagnose PDH issues in "strange locales".
   If anyone hates this let me know and I will add an option to use "old ansi log".
 * Fixed so the console is logged as ANSI (properly) and all Unicode's are discarded.
   This means "strangeness" in Unicode and non-us-ascii chars on the console,
    so for details refer to the log-file which is proper Unicode.
 + Since log module is loaded "after" the client has booted I added a "hello" message that prints the current version
    (if you find this annoying let me know, I will make it optional :)
 * Fixed some issues in the registry handling

2008-03-06 MickeM
 * Fixed silly ordering bug with the <> syntax.

2008-03-05 MickeM
 + Added debug to new section [Eventlog], when enabled it will (log) what lines matched what, this is a pretty big performance overhead so don't run with this one.
 + Added syntax to new section [Eventlog] used as a shorthand for the syntax to use as "default" (when no syntax=... option is given)
 * Fixed an issue with eventlog and . matching.
 + Added shorthand ! for != in "all" numeric filters (eventlog)
 + Added <> (same as ! and !=) as NRPE breaks the use of ! (in "all" numeric filters (eventlog))
   Try using: filter-eventType=<>warning to remove everything that is not a warning
 * Fixed two spelling mistakes in the SysTray module.
 * Fixed 64-bit issues with installer
 * Fixed so installer uninstalls/installs the service
 
2008-02-26 MickeM
 + Added installer
 
2008-02-22 MickeM
 * Fixed issues in the NRPE module (now returns the correct status)
 + Added a lot of "error log" for when the packet size in NRPEListener is not correct 
    (might make it simpler to diagnose problems)

2008-02-20 MickeM
 + Added new module NRPEClient that can act as a NRPE client, might be useful for testing things and 
   eventually for relaying events.
   Usage: nsclient++ -noboot NRPEClient -H 192.168.0.1 -p 5666 -c check_something -a foo bar
   This is an early concept so don't expect much...
 * Fixed a bug in NSCA module (now it works again :)
 + Added a command wrapper for the NRPECLient module so now it can act as a check command.
   (No argument handling yet though), For a sample check out the [NRPE Client Handlers] section in NSC.ini

2008-02-19 MickeM
 + Fixed a buffer overflow in the NRPE socket handling.
 
2008-02-18 MickeM
 + Added proper output handling to process subsystem (now you can execute programs that return "much" data.
 + Added select support for SSL_write (now you can send "any amount of data" to the (SSL) socket.
   Since check_nrpe doesn't do this it wont work in that end, but still...

2008-02-16 MickeM
 + Re factored ExternalCommand handling so NRPE and new module does the same thing.

2008-02-14 MickeM
 + Added so commands starting in host_ (NSCA Handlers) are sent as host-commands
 * Fixed a copy constructor in NSCA Commands (now service checks are sent as service checks)

2008-02-13 MickeM
 + Added string_length to [Settings] as well (used internally) for all "injected" buffers.
 * Fixed issue with scripts result truncated after 1024 chars 
    (now they return "all" output and thus you can use the NRPE settings I added yesterday :)
 + Added hostname setting to [NSCA] section (must have been  when I did not add it before)
 + Added to NSCA truncates output when to long.

2008-02-12 MickeM
 + Added new option for the [NRPE] section string_length which is the length of the NRPE strings 
   (notice you need to recompile the check_nrpe to match this value)
 * Improved exception handling in the PDH collector (hopefully less deadlocks)

2008-02-11 MickeM
 + Added encryption support for NSCA module (about half of the algorithms are available, 
     if someone wants to use one not available let me know, and I will try to add it)

2008-02-09 MickeM
 + New module CheckExternalScripts to handle 1, external script (similar to the old NRPE but in its own module)
   - Can Check batch/vbs/programs/*
   - Works with NSCA module (if you don't want to have NRPE at the same time)
   - Simpler syntax (discarded old and added new section for alias)
   - Started to add "sample alias" to ease initial setup and give some nice ideas (please provide me with feedback on them)

2008-02-08 MickeM
 + Added some more default catch handlers (on the "core" side of plugin-calls).

2008-02-07 MickeM
 + Added default catch handlers to all wrapped plug in calls.

2008-02-05 MickeM
 * Fixed issue with checkEventLog (sometimes you got the wrong message back)

2008-02-04 MickeM
 *** Happy Birthday bogi!! :)
 * Fixed issues with performance counter rendering (mainly checkDisk)

2008-02-03 MickeM
 + Added encryption subsystem to NSCA module (still no mcrypt support, but at least you have "xor" and passwords)
 + Added API for scripts to register commands
 + Added command descriptions (for some modules)
 * Fixed issue in NRPE that displayed a console window when running commands
 * New improved "inject" dialog from the system tray
   Lists available commands, and shows command descriptions and a lot of other improvements.
 + Added an internal log windows that displays log in real-time.
 + Fixed some issues with the dialog procs (should work smoother now, especially Termination)

2008-02-02 MickeM
 * Might have fixed the "missing eventlog messages" problem.
 + Added %count% parameter to syntax which (when used with unique) will display the number of hits for each message displayed.

2008-01-27 MickeM
 * Fixed a memory-leak in format_time
 * Fixed so time/date is displayed in "local time" (not UTC) for the eventlog check
 + Added %message% to eventlog check. Will display the "proper formated eventlog message" as in the eventlog viewer.
   For this to work you need to have the descriptions flag set
   In short: /nrpe -H 192.168.0.147 -c checkEventLog -a truncate=1024 "syntax=%generated%: %message%" descriptions=true file=System MaxWarn=1 MaxCrit=1 filter+eventType==error filter+generated=\<12h filter=new filter=all filter=in
 + Added option "unique" to CheckEventLog If this is present only unique errors will be returned.
   The uniqueness is defined by event-log, event-source, event-id and event-category.

2007-12-16 MickeM
 + A lot of new features in the LUA module only "arguments" missing (as well as exposing more of the API)
 * Changed some exceptions that were thrown wrong

2007-12-11 MickeM
 + Added support for index-lookups of PDH counters (hopefully *all* locale problems are now fixed (yeah right))

2007-12-10 MickeM
 + Added initial draft for LUA module

2007-12-09 MickeM
 + Added a check if the service is started when running with /test so you get a warning
 + Improved the socket thread with:
    * a default-catch
    * If the socket fails to start we still wait for it to shut down (no error message)
 + Added first version of the NSCA agent (NSCAgent.dll)
   (no encryption support as of yet, but will come)

2007-12-04 MickeM
 ! 0.3.0 Released

2007-12-01 MickeM

 + Added an error message if the "detected" process enumeration method is not available.
 + Fixed some more Unicode issues Password encrypt/decrypt: #107
 * Fixed Unicode issues with "external programs" #109
 * Fixed so default string for check_nt:s FILEAGE command is "delta" is 5 minutes ago (and not absolute ie. 1970...), Issue #39
 + added support for  <date strings> to check_nt:s FILEAGE command, Issue #39
    append: .<date string> if you want to use a "custom date" like so: ... -v FILEAGE -l c:\\windows,Date: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" -w 5 -c 6 ...
    Only the above listed %<char> works, and default to 0 so might not be to pretty but works...

2007-11-26 MickeM
 + Fixed a socket issue (erroneously reported "Could not read NSClient packet from socket :(")
 * More 2k5 build tweaks

2007-11-23 MickeM
 * Converted to Unicode (damn sometimes I **HATE** C++)
 + Added support for escaping " on the /test syntax so now you can do: CheckWMI MaxCrit=3 "MinWarn=1" "Query:load=Select * from win32_Processor"

2007-11-22 MickeM
 * Fixed so the "default path" is correct even when running as a service (issue: #96)

2007-11-21 MickeM
 * Fixed process counter so checkProcState  now return the *correct* number (previously it was correct-1)
 * Fixed some missing exceptions that were not caught
 + Added "AliasCol" option to CheckWMIValue to allow a column to be used as "alias" for a result set:
     CheckWMIValue -a "Query=select Caption, ThreadCount from Win32_Process" MaxWarn=50 MaxCrit=100 Check:threads=ThreadCount AliasCol=Caption
    will give you: "System threads: 98 > warning, svchost.exe threads: 87 > warning"
 - Removed  from SVN (as it is old and outdated and no longer used)

2007-11-20 MickeM
 + Added new option to CheckSystem to override detected language (force_language=0x0014)

2007-11-19 MickeM

 + Added sample VBS script and definitions

2007-11-15 MickeM
 * Improved error message when external NRPE command failles.

2007-11-14 MickeM
 + Added multi-line output support ( issue #91 )
 * Improved error handling for external commands
 * Fixed an issue with NRPE/NSClient socket-reading (introduced by the socket_timeout)
 + Added an English fall back if "local" language PDH counters fail.

2007-11-12 MickeM
 + Added option to configure socket_timeouts (default is now 30 seconds) should (I hope) fix issue #85

2007-11-11 MickeM
 + Added option to configure the behavior of CheckService CheckAll (#64)

2007-11-08 MickeM
 + Added CheckWMIValue to check result-values from a WMI Query
 * Changed so performance values are "collapsed" i.e. 75362115584 = 70.0G (#89)
    If anyone don't want this let me know and I will make an option for it.

2007-11-06 MickeM
 + Added CLI interface to CheckWMI to check queries

2007-11-04 MickeM
 * Rewritten WMI handling as well as checks so things should be more useful now (cf. the wiki page for details)

 * Fixed the "check memory" issues for real this time.
 * Fixed problem with : in counter names #50 (anything starts with \ is considered a counter so if you use aliases with \ this will break things for you.

2007-06-20 MickeM

   subdirectory. The script_dir will use all files in this directory as scripts for NRPE
 + Added Japanese counters to counters.defs from patch (thanx!!!)

2007-02-25 MickeM
 + Added possibility to check many memory checks in one go, just stack type options.
     type=paged type=physical etc...
 * Fixed a performance check bug in the last nightly.
 * Fixed a potential crash when a malformed check-file-age command was issued.
 + Added support for more then and NSClient command

 + Added option CheckAll for checking all auto-start services to checkServiceState.
   Also an exclude=<service> to exclude checking that.
 * Fixed return syntax for PROCSTATE nsclient

2007-02-21 MickeM
 * Fixed "broken password check" (again) in NSClient listener (this time it is correct! :)

2006-12-02 MickeM
 + Managed to build so it works on NT 4.0 (SP6a) and W2K3
 * Fixed "broken password check" in NSClient listener

2006-11-18 MickeM
 + Added support for empty NRPE checking (i.e.. chec_nrpe without a -c argument)
 * Added error message when detected language is missing from counters.defs
 + Added Swedish locale to counters.defs (yes, I switched to Swedish XP on my computer :)
 * Fixed : (and possibly other problems) in counters when checking from check_nt (via NSCLient protocol)
 + Added CheckAllExcept to CheckDrive to check all except the specified drives.
 * Fixed a display error in the various size functions (1000-1024 byte was displayed incorrectly)

2006-10-05 MickeM
 * Yayyy!!! (first fix in a looong while :)
 * Fixed a W2k3 "bug" (actually just an incorrect error) but the:
   "e .\PDHCollector.cpp(130) Failed to query performance counters..." is no more...
 + Added option to NRPE/NSClient section to not-cache host names (for dyndns etc.)
   NOTICE this is "not safe" really in so far as someone might hi-jack your DNS and quickly gain 
   access to your nagios box (probably only a theoretical problem but hey! :)
   NOTICE this is "slow" since all hosts in the list are "looked up" each time you get a NRPE/NSClient 
   request it will be "slow" but I think it is not that much of a problem really.
   NOTICE I don't have the possibility to test this so feel free to report if it works and if it doesn't.
   Set cache_allowed_hosts=0 to disable host cache

2006-04-04 MickeM
 * Fixed a few more bugs to the INI/REG readers

2006-04-02 MickeM
 * Could all magicians stop trying to kill me? 
   *Please* i don't like to die!

2006-03-31 MickeM
 * Damn necromancers! stop 0wning my ass all the time!
 
2006-03-29 MickeM
 + Added API for saving/reading settings
 
2006-03-28 MickeM
 + Added REG/INI parsers
 * *NOTICE* You need to add an option (use_file=1) to your nsc.ini file or new builds wont work.

2006-03-25 MickeM
 * Oblivion f*cking roxx!

2006-03-02 MickeM
 * Fixed bug in INI-file reader (memory leak)

2006-03-01 MickeM
 * Fixed bug in CheckFile (now dates work correctly)

2006-02-26 MickeM
 + Added syntax option to CheckFile (%filename%, %creation%, %access%, %write%, %size%).

2006-02-25 MickeM
 * Fixed Sections problem (now sections can be any size)
 + Added bind_to_address option to both NRPE and NSClient section in the INI file.
   Allows you to bind the listener to a specific IP address (only dotted number not host name).
   This might break things as I had to do some internal rewrite of the Socket classes so be careful :)
 * Disabled default-debug logging (as things are fairly stable, you can still enable it by using debug=1 in the NSC:ini file)
 * "Fixed" socket backlog to use "max responsible value" as opposed to "10" if no value is specified.
 + Added option socket_back_log to both NRPE and NSClient section that allows you to tweak the "back-log" of incoming connections to keep.
   This is an advanced setting and should not be used. If you get "connection refused" when running many client this might be something you want to tweak though.
   And if you then start getting "Socket timeout" you might wanna tweak the timeout value as well because larger value here means it takes "longer" to process a socket.
 - I have looked into the event log problem and dates seem to work here so if anyone still have problems (use the syntax option to debug) let me know.
 * Moved listpdh and debugpdh into the CheckSystem module
 * Removed PDH dependencies from "core exe" means you can run NSClient++ without PDH (though you cant use the CheckSystem module)
 
2006-02-2? MickeM
 + Added new Interface for Modules (NSCommandLineExec that allows modules to execute things give from command line.
   Syntax is NSClient++ <module name> <command> [arguments] and if a module doesn't support this it is simply ignored.
 + Added new install/uninstall command to SystemTray module:
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray install 
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray uninstall 
   That will install/uninstall the system tray module this sets the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag for the service.
 * Removed the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag from the /install option so that it no longer defaults to on (see commands to set this above).
 * Fixed so checkProcess isn't case sensitive.
 * Added (not finished) syntax option to event log checker to format the outputted data

 ! Fixed filter-eventID in EventLog module (now works for all IDs regardless of severity state)

2006-02-07 MickeM

 + Started to convert the web page to WIKI
 
2006-01-21 MickeM
 + Added WMI Check module (early alpha)
   This is an extremely early alpha more to see if there is an interest and how to progress with it.
   To use the WMI module enable the WMICheck.dll (nsc.ini) and then run the following check:
   CheckWMI MaxWarn=10 MaxCrit=15 "Query:load=Select LoadPercentage from win32_Processor"
   The Max* are as every other check and sets limits. 
   The Query works similarly to other check commands i.e.. Query:<name>=<WMI query>
   So any other WMI query should work (notice this is experimental and not stable and has virtually 
   no error handling so it is likely to crash nsclient if you ask anything "non working".)
   I would *really* *really* like to get feedback on how to expand this concept to work better so feel free to come with feedback.
